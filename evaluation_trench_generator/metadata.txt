changelog=2.15
 - Changed Trench Length from integer number to decimal number
 <p>2.10
 - Fix issue with folder structure (missing /Shapefiles) when the project is not saved on the disk.
   Now, if the project is not saved on disk, the new layers are temporary and warning message will appear.
   If the project is saved on disk, the code check for the subfodler /Shapefiles and, if not present, creates it. 
 - Added button to generate an empty Trench LOE layer
 <p>2.04
 - Changed rotation value from 22.5 to 10 to give more control to the user
 <p>2.03
 - Fixed minor bug on Stakeout_points name when it contains a suffux '_1, _2, etc'
 <p>2.02
 - Stake-out points generator, if reused on the same project, generate sequential filenames for StakeOut_Points (e.g., StakeOut_Points_1.shp)
 - Added new style for Trench_LOE with different colours according to trench size (more or less 30m)
 <p>2.01
 - Trench generator, if reused on the same project, generate sequential filenames for Trench_LOE (e.g., Trench_LOE_1.shp)
 - Improved autoexclusion on trench calculation type
 - Added option for generate stakeout points for trenches or for excavation LOE
 - Removed generate route button
 - Stakeout route numereation improved with 1.5 meter buffer tollerance
 <p>2.0
 - Restyling mask interfaces
 - New shapefiles are now saved in the disk and not temporary
